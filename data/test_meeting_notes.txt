Q1 Planning Meeting - Jan 15
Attendees: Alice, Bob, Carol

Alice: We need to finalize the budget by end of week. I propose we cut marketing by 10% and reallocate to R&D.
Bob: I disagree. Marketing drove 40% of leads last quarter. We should look at ops instead.
Carol: Can we get numbers on both options before deciding?

DECISIONS:
- Budget review deferred to Friday
- Alice to prepare R&D proposal
- Bob to prepare marketing ROI report

ACTION ITEMS:
- Alice: R&D proposal by Thursday (no owner for budget consolidation)
- Bob: Marketing report by Wednesday
- Carol: Schedule Friday meeting

OPEN QUESTIONS:
- What's our runway if we delay the hire?
- Who owns the budget consolidation?
