DASHBOARD BEST PRACTICES SUMMARY

The document defines the complete design philosophy, structure, and role-based blueprints for a BI Dashboard. Its purpose is to transform data visualization into decision intelligence — actionable, trusted insights that connect human judgment with AI-driven recommendations.

I. STRATEGIC FOUNDATION

Five Pillars:

Role-Centric Design: Each role gets data relevant to its workflow.

Clarity & Simplicity: Minimal clutter, focused visuals, limited color palette.

Action-Oriented Insights: Highlight anomalies and required actions.

Visual Storytelling: Logical flow, hierarchy, narrative layout.

Trust in AI: Show reasoning, accuracy history, and transparency.

II. ARCHITECTURE — “3-CLICK INFORMATION HIERARCHY”

A consistent 3-level structure using progressive disclosure:

Level 0 (At-a-Glance): Quick health check with 3–5 key KPIs and alerts.

Level 1 (Drill-Down): Diagnostic charts to explain causes.

Level 2 (Deep-Dive): Raw data tables for validation/export.

Navigation mirrors real causal links.

III. ROLE BLUEPRINTS

1. Gerencia (Management)

Focus: overall efficiency, profitability, and ROI. Central goal tracking linking KPIs across roles.

2. Financiero (Finance)

Focus: Client reservations and payment status. Budget projections vs. actuals. Payment alerts and delinquency tracking. Financial analysis and cash flow.

3. Contabilidad (Accounting)

Focus: Bank reconciliation. Audit logs.

4. Ventas (Sales)

Focus: maximize sales while preventing delinquency.

5. Inventario (Inventory)

Focus: real time inventory accuracy and operational efficiency.

6. Maestro (Master)

Focus: system uptime, integrations, API health, user activity, logs, settings. Management of catalogues: roles, users, etc.

IV. VISUALIZING AI RECOMMENDATIONS

Trust through transparency:

Forecasts shown with confidence intervals (not absolute lines).

V. CROSS-FUNCTIONAL SYNERGY & ADVANCED CAPABILITIES

Shareable, annotated views for team collaboration.

Natural Language Query (NLQ): ask “show me late suppliers this month.”

Embedded analytics.

AI narratives: auto-generated plain-language summaries explaining dashboard insights.

VI. UNIFIED TIME NAVIGATION AND ANALYSIS

1. Core Objective

To create a standardized, powerful, and intuitive time navigation component that is seamlessly integrated into Level 1 and Level 2 dashboards. This component will be the single-source-of-truth for all time-based filtering, enabling users to perform historic consultations, comparisons, and trend analyses with minimal cognitive load.

2. Guiding Design Principles

Consistency: The component's appearance, location, and functionality will be identical across all dashboards. This predictability is key to making it intuitive.

Context-Awareness: The component will default to a logical time frame based on the user's entry point (e.g., clicking a "Last 30 Days" KPI on a Level 0 dashboard sets the component to that range).

Efficiency: Common look-up periods will be single-click actions, while complex custom ranges remain easily accessible.

3. The Unified Time Navigation Component: Anatomy and Functionality

This component will be a persistent header element present on all Level 1 and Level 2 dashboards.

It consists of three primary controls:

A. Mode Selector: A set of toggle buttons that fundamentally changes the analysis type.

Single Period (Default): For historic consultation. The user selects one date range to view data.

Compare: For historic comparison. The user selects two distinct, non-overlapping date ranges.

Trend: For historic analysis. This is functionally similar to "Single Period" but optimized for visualizing data over longer time horizons.

B. Date Range Selector: The primary interactive element.

Quick Presets: A series of buttons for the most common look-ups. This is non-negotiable for efficiency.

Last 7 Days

Last 30 Days

Month-to-Date (MTD)

Year-to-Date (YTD)

Last 12 Months

Last 24 Months

Custom Range Input: A standard calendar date picker that allows the user to define a specific Start Date and End Date. When in Compare mode, this section will display two sets of custom range inputs: Period A and Period B.

C. Data Granularity Control: A dropdown menu that dictates the time-based aggregation for all visualizations on the dashboard.

Daily

Weekly

Monthly (Default)

Yearly

4. Component Behavior and Dashboard Interaction

On a Level 1 and 2 Dashboard Load: The component inherits its initial state from the user's prior action. If the user clicks a Level 0 widget showing "Perfect Order Rate (Last 30 Days)," the component will load with Single Period mode active and the Last 30 Days preset selected.

In "Single Period" / "Trend" Mode:

All charts and tables on the dashboard update to reflect the selected date range and granularity.

KPI widgets will show the value for the selected period.

In "Compare" Mode: The entire dashboard visualization layer adapts to show comparison.

Line Charts: Display two lines, one for Period A (e.g., solid line) and one for Period B (e.g., dashed line).

Bar Charts: Use grouped bars to show Period A and Period B side-by-side for each category.

KPI Widgets: Display three key pieces of information:

Value for the current period (Period A).

Absolute change from the prior period (Period B).

Percentage change (% delta). 

Example: A KPI widget would show: $1.2M | +$150k | +14.3%

5. Design Prompt for Implementation

Here is a precise prompt to give to a UI/UX designer or front-end developer to build this system.

Prompt: Design and Implement a Unified Time Navigation Component

Objective: Develop a single, reusable dashboard component for all time-based data analysis. This component must be intuitive, efficient, and support three core user tasks: historical lookup, period-over-period comparison, and trend analysis.

Component Requirements:

Placement: The component must be fixed at the top of all Level 1 and Level 2 dashboard views, below the main page title but above all widgets.

Mode Selection:

Implement a toggle control with three options: Single Period, Compare, and Trend.

The Single Period mode shall be the default.

Date Selection:

Provide one-click preset buttons for: Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, MTD, YTD, Last 12 Months, and Last 24 Months.

Include a custom calendar date-range picker (Start Date / End Date).

When Compare mode is active, display two distinct date-range pickers: "Period A" and "Period B," each with its own calendar control. "Period A" should default to the most recent period.

Granularity Control:

Include a dropdown menu to set data aggregation to Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly. Monthly is the default.

Changing the granularity must automatically re-render all time-series visualizations on the dashboard.

Interaction Logic:

The component's state (mode, date range, granularity) must be the single source of truth for all data displayed on the dashboard.

When a user clicks a widget on a Level 0 dashboard, the component on the resulting Level 1 view must initialize with the time context of that widget.

In Compare mode, all visual components must adapt. Line charts will show two series; bar charts will use grouped bars; KPI indicators must display the current value, absolute change, and percentage change.

CONCLUSION

The Dashboard is designed as the central nervous system of the app — a system that:

Builds trust through understandability and accuracy transparency.

Enforces clarity, consistency, and causality in every interaction.

Provides role-tailored, action-oriented intelligence within a 3-click hierarchy.

Fosters collaboration and cross-departmental problem solving.

Result: a BI system that transforms data into decisions, algorithms into advisors, and users into empowered partners.
